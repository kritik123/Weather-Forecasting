# üöÄ Getting Started

- Install Nodejs [\*\*here](https://nodejs.org) on the local machine. (Required)

**\*Follow the instructions given below to set up the project locally on your machine.\***

## Basic Setup

- Clone the `local-setup` branch in the repository

```bash

git clone -b local-setup https://github.com/kritik123/weather-forecasting.git

```

- Install the packages using the command `npm install`

## **Environment File**

- Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. Add the following properties in it:

```bash

REACT_APP_DARKSKY_API_KEY=<your Dark Sky API Key>

```

- Obtain the API key mentioned in the `.env` by following below steps:

* Get API tokens:

* You can obtain a Dark Sky API key [\*\*here](https://darksky.net/dev) (Required)

> _These instructions are very important to avoid the **Blank Page** issue when running the application on `http://localhost:3000`._

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.Open `[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)` to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about

[**running tests**](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [**deployment**](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

`npm run eject`

**Note**: _this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can‚Äôt go back!_

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## üí° Motivation

I started learning React in May 2019 and thought of putting knowledge into reality by developing an application. I am interested in building an application that is API resource-intensive to challenge me writing efficient code keeping performance, UX, maintainability, scalability, and optimization in mind.

There are so many weather-related applications out in the wild. So, the goal is to create a UI that is beautiful yet simple and effective for any user to use.

## üíª Technologies

- This application is created with **[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)**

- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** _(v16.12)_

- Styling syntax was written in SCSS and using **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**

- There are bunch of scripts that run when you start application to compile `scss` to `css`

## üò¢ Challenges

- First, I used the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather forecast data. However, 5-day forecast data was not reliable i.e. _when a user on 14th March 2020 at 7:00 PM EST tries to fetch 5-day forecast data, will get forecast data starting 15th March 2020 at 12:00 AM UTC._ This posed a big problem of categorizing 5-day data into individual days since the data is not always consistent and is based on UTC and not based on the user timezone. Finally, I switched to Dark Sky API which is more reliable and provides a robust data model. However, there is a limit of `1000` calls/day.

- Dark Sky API needs a proxy server to send and receive a response which was easy in the development stage using a browser extension like **[this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-orign-cors-changer/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc)** to enable CORS in the browser. However, I can't ask every user to install this extension in their browser to check the weather forecast. So, I overcome this issue temporarily for now using the `cors-anywhere` library which you can get more info by checking **[here](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere)**.
